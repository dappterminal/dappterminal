# Agents

This project uses lightweight, role-based agent guidance to keep work focused and consistent.

## Roles

- Architect: defines component boundaries, state, and interactions.
- Implementer: writes code with minimal scope.
- Reviewer/QA: verifies behavior, edge cases, and suggests tests.
- Designer: refines grid aesthetics and UI polish.

## Usage

- Use only the roles relevant to the task.
- Keep scope minimal for each role; avoid cross-role overlap unless required.
- When multiple roles apply, state the order you are using them.
